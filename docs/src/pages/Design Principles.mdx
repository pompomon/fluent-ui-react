  Stardust uses some unique component patterns.
  These patterns are the result of a great amount thought, debate, and vetting.

This page gives you the assumptions and reasoning we've used that drives our design decisions.

## TODO

Walk through a component file and explain WHY each of the design patterns in it exist.

# First Principles

## Component Anatomies

Standardized component anatomies are at the core of the Stardust's approach to components concept.
A component anatomy is simply a name of component and all of its parts.

Stardust bases on design decisions on these principles:

### Framework Agnostic

Although this doc site is about React components, the internals of these components are built using framework agnostic parts.

### Design Agnostic

Stardust components do not dictate any theme.

### Extend, override, or replace anything at any time

**Why?**

**How?**
Stardust components aim to allow you to extend, override, or replace the state, styling, and accessibility features of any component at any time.
Our components attempt to "do the right thing" by default, but do not lock you in to any decision.

This is usually achieved by allowing the user to pass state, style, and accessibility information through React context or component props.

## Conformance

All Stardust components are tested against conformance criteria. This ensures that components behave in a consistent and predictable way.

### `test('component info file exists')`

### `test('spreads "attributes" on root')`

**Problem:**
**Solution:**

### `test('handles events transparently')`

**Problem:**
**Solution:**

### `test('matches constructor name')`

## `as` prop

Stardust UI provides a way to compose React components through the `as` prop. It allows to compose component features and props without adding extra nested components.

```jsx
<>
  {/* üß± Each Stardust UI component has a default value for `as` prop */}
  {/* Will output: <h1 class="ui-header" /> */}
  <Header />
  {/* Uses another tag: <h2 class="ui-header" /> */}
  <Header as="h2" />
</>
```

<Alert warning>
  <p>
    Using <code>as</code> prop can change the behavior of the component. If this prop is used it is
    the responsibility of the consumer to verify accessibility and styling aspects of the component
    and handle them correctly.
  </p>
</Alert>

## Unhandled props & DOM attributes

Our components handle only props that are defined in their interfaces, all unhandled props are passed to the component you are rendering `as`. It means that all HTML props are supported on all Stardust UI components.

```jsx
<>
  {/* `type` is an unhandled prop on `Button` and is passed through ‚¨áÔ∏è*/}
  {/* Will output: <button class="ui-button" type="submit" /> */}
  <Button type="submit" />
  {/* `onLoad` and `onError` will be passed to `img` */}
  {/* Will output: <img class="ui-image" src="//placehold.it/300" /> */}
  <Image src="//placehold.it/300" onLoad={() => alert('Loaded')} onError={() => alert('Error')} />
</>
```

This is also essential for working with third party libraries like `react-router`.

```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

// üí° `to` prop is not handled in `Button` and will be passed to `Link` component
;<Button as={Link} to="/home">
  To homepage
</Button>
```
